# JWT
JWT Editor extension 
A JWT consists of 3 parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. These are each separated by a dot  
Header -  base64url-encoded, metadata about the token itself
Payload - base64url-encoded,  
Signature - server that issues the token typically generates the signature by hashing the header and payload. In some cases, they also encrypt the resulting hash.
